1. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM? 
JVM executes bytecode. JRE provides the runtime environment including the JVM and standard libraries. JDK includes JRE plus development tools like the compiler. So JDK is for development, JRE is for running applications.

2. How does the JVM work?
The JVM loads compiled bytecode, verifies it, and executes it using an interpreter and JIT compiler. It manages memory through heap and stack areas and automatically handles garbage collection, making Java platform-independent and memory-safe.
