1. What is the difference between val and var?

val and var differ in mutability:
val → immutable reference (cannot be reassigned)
var → mutable reference (can be reassigned)

Example:
val name = "Papa"
name = "Alex"   // ❌ Compilation error

var age = 30
age = 31        // ✅ Allowed

👉 Important:
val means the reference cannot change, but the object itself may still be mutable.

Short interview answer:
val defines a read-only reference, while var defines a mutable reference that can be reassigned.
